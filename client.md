## Anatomy of a website (or web app)

A website typically consists of three parts:

1. The HTML which describes how to lay the website out
2. The CSS which describes how to make the website look
3. The JavaScript which describes how to make the website come alive.

## Selfies

To start:

1. Open Terminal
2. Create a folder called `selfies` by using `mkdir selfies`
3. Navigte to the folder using `cd selfies`
4. Create a file `index.html` by using `touch index.html`
5. Create a file `index.css`
6. Create a file `index.js`
7. Open the `selfies` folder in Sublime Text

Every website has a standard format for HTML that all browsers can read. Read and copy the example template from here https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp and paste it in your `index.html` file.

There are many HTML elements, but practically only the `div` element is needed and used as the main building block for websites. Empty the contents of the `body` tag in your `index.html` and add a new empty `div` like `<div>Selfies</div>`.

Open your `index.html` file in Google Chrome.
