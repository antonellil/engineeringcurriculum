Welcome to the software engineering curriculum!

# 1) Computer overview

- Terminal is just another way to interact with the computer and view files and run programs
- cd, ls for navigating and viewing files, mkdir for creating folders

## Git

- Server is what the client talks to in order to send and retrieve things from the client
  - Server is just a computer somewhere that the client talks to

# 6) Database

- PostgreSQL overview and tutorials
- Role of the database (storage, retrieval)
- Building practical database tables and usage

# 7) Caching

- Redis overview and tutorials
- Role of caching (often-accessed values, limiting database reads)
- Building practical things with caching

# 8) End-to-end

- Build several applications end-to-end through all layers of the stack
